In the chapter, "Mapping events/Mapping Social Media," I thought it was amazing how social media data could be used to analyze revolutions and other historical events. 
In the chapter, the athor writes that, "it seems incontestable that the 'public images' produced by broadcast media are being supplanted by decentralized, multi-
directional "public utterances" that are changing the way in which events unfold, become represented, and are diseeminated." This quote particularly stood out to 
me because it shows the power of social media in this current age and how participants experiencing events first-hand have a voice, not only in how events are seen and 
portrayed in history, but also in how they unfold in the present. For instance, during the Egyptian revolution, a surge of twitter data on February 10th and 11th about
shifts in power could have been a sign that the revolution was reaching an inflection point. Each of the individual tweets and stories from people experiencing the event
served as simple acts that built a community and a large, complex network that defined the evnt in history. However, while social media allows for individual voices to be heard, 
the authors of the chapter also acknowledge how unreliable social media data can be and how it can amplify misinformation on a global scale. Many different contradictory 
perspectives can being expressed through traditional and social media which could potentially cause these events to fall victim to information overload. For instance, 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, the spread of an overwhelming amount of contradictory infromation and misinformation caused many people to ignore proper COVID-19 safety 
and health protocols. On this note, I would ask the authors of the book how they would analyze social media data about COVID-19 and if any current data trends show 
turning points during the pandemic.
