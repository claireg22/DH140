In this article, Nancy Doss shares data she has collected on COVID-19 case and deaths statistics around the world and the major causes 
of death. To analyze her data, she employed different data visualization methods to create charts using python. First, to extract COVID-19
world statistics, Doss creates a choleropath map to show how many cases each country had throughout 2020 and a line plot that shows 
the total number of confirmed cases and deaths. Then, Doss provides one bar plot showing the total confirmed cases and deaths of the top 10 
affected countries and another bar graph showing the total deaths of the top 10 countries with highest recorded COVID deaths. The top 10
countries on both graphs did not align with each other, suggesting there must be additional factors that contribute to COVID deaths. 
To study this further, Doss provides 4 donut charts representing 4 COVID death factors: prevalence of diabetes, life expectancy, 
population aged 65 or older, and GDP per capita. These graphs showed that European countries have higher COVID deaths because of a 
greater older/aged population and South America's low GDP per capita could be a contirbuting factor to the continent's high death rates. 

I chose this article because Doss' visualization of COVID-19 data helped me put in perspective how COVID-19 affects communities around the world 
in different ways. Doss' data showed me that there can not be one global solution to reducing the spread of COVID-19 since there are cultural, geographic, 
and demographic differences between countries around the world that may affect how COVID spreads or impacts people. The data shows that there are
correlations between many different factors and the spread of COVID-19 that governments around the world need to address to reduce the number of cases 
and deaths. Moreover, I realized that combining and comparing diverse data sets can uncover relationships between variables that may be unclear at 
first. For instance, Doss looks at COVID death factors in each continent to analyze how demographic trends in different geographic areas explain why 
some countries have higher COVID-10 death rates than others. Furthermore, Doss is able to support her claims and explanations with statistical evidence, 
which adds more credibility and prevents risks of spreading speculation or fake news. I also thought it was interesting how data can be visualized in 
many different forms to make understanding it more clear and and easy to understand. I really liked how Doss strategically chose different types of graphs 
to portray different kinds of data and look forward to learning about how I can apply that into my own data visualization project.
